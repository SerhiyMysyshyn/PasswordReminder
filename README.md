# Android Application "Password Reminder"
__________________________________________
The application is developed for storing and administering passwords

The main objectives of the program:
1) Save passwords in the cloud storage
2) Two-stage password encryption
3) Access saved passwords without connecting to the network
4) Add, edit and delete your own passwords 

______________________________________________________________________
The program is mainly designed for children and the elderly, because it is difficult for them to remember their passwords.
You can not worry about the integrity of your data, because our program uses two-step data encryption. No one will be able to intercept and use your passwords.
The program implements a convenient mechanism for copying login and password, which will allow the user to quickly copy the desired data.
If you want to delete all your data so that PasswordReminder doesn't know anything about you - just click the "Delete account" button in your personal account.
The program is updated periodically, which ensures the security of your data at the highest level.
